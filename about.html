      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        This platform is not a hospital or medical provider. Instead, it serves as a curated guide to 
        help patients, caregivers, and curious minds explore famous hospitals, learn about their unique 
        specialties, and make more informed healthcare decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        With the growing demand for high-quality healthcare and medical tourism, our goal is to help you
        understand which hospitals are leaders in their fieldsâ€”from cardiac surgery to cancer care,
        neurology, and beyond.
